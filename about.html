  Hi. My names is Dominik Vasko, currently I am a university student in Slovakia. This page was created as part of one of my projects. If you already checked out my blog you will find that one of my hobbies is GNU/linux and software associated with it.

  Since at the momemnt I am working on my Bachelors thesis(about neural text generation), you will also find some blog posts about either downloading some datasets or training neural networks.

  Last but not least I'm also a fan of oldschool games mainly from the era of 2000's or the 90's.
