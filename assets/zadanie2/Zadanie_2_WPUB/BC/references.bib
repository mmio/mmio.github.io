  abstract  = {We present PASS, a data-to-text system that generates Dutch soccer reports from
	match statistics. One of the novel elements of PASS is the fact that the system
	produces corpus-based texts tailored towards fans of one club or the other,
	which can most prominently be observed in the tone of voice used in the
	reports. Furthermore, the system is open source and uses a modular design,
	which makes it relatively easy for people to add extensions. Human-based
	evaluation shows that people are generally positive towards PASS in regards to
	its clarity and fluency, and that the tailoring is accurately recognized in
	most cases.},
